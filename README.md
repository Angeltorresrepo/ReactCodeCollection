# ReactCodeCollection
ReactCodeCollection is a curated collection of React projects organized by complexity levels. This repository serves as a practical playground for honing React skills with well-structured, logically rich frontend applications. Whether you are starting out or aiming to deepen your knowledge, you’ll find projects designed to challenge and inspire.

## About this Repository

This repository hosts a variety of projects aimed at helping developers improve their skills. Projects are organized into two main folders based on complexity and focus:

CoreProjects — Solid projects that cover essential frontend concepts and practical implementations, including React and JavaScript.

AdvancedChallenges — Projects that tackle more complex logic, performance optimizations, and advanced patterns, suitable for experienced developers.

⚠️ Note: Projects inside CoreProjects may look straightforward but often contain intricate logic and valuable learning opportunities.

## Future Plans

While this repository currently emphasizes React frontend projects, the scope will soon expand to include:

- Advanced JavaScript projects (beyond React)
- Java backend projects
- Spring Boot applications

This will turn **ReactCodeCollection** into a comprehensive learning resource covering both frontend and backend technologies.

## Why ReactCodeCollection?

- Hands-on projects to strengthen programming skills across multiple technologies.
- Clear folder structure by difficulty for easy navigation.
- Focus on best practices, real-world logic, and practical applications.
- Great for portfolio building and interview preparation.
